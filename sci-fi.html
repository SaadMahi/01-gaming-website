          James Heller can shapeshift and assume other people's identities and
          memories by consuming them. Taking people's identities and
          shapeshifting into them has become more tactical. Due to Blackwatch's
          actions in the Yellow Zone, if the player assumes the role of a
          soldier, people will react to him in a way that shows that they want
          nothing to do with him. To make sure that enemies do not overwhelm the
          player, Radical has created a dodging system and new, more realistic
          AI. Heller will be able to use weapons in the game, such as ripping
          the Gatling cannon off a tank and using it against enemies. Heller can
          also sneak up on unsuspecting human enemies, inject them with the
          Blacklight virus turning them into "BioBomb" to blow up spectacularly.
          Heller also has superhuman strength and agility, near-invulnerability
          to harm, near-flight leaping and gliding, infinite stamina, increased
          speed, and has a sonar sense. The sonar includes a new pulse ability
          that highlights the key features of an environment to make it easier
          for the player to find someone, instead of looking in a large crowd
          for a person with an icon above their head. Radical has stated that
          the powers will be more meaningful, appearing as mutations and
          upgrades that let players decide how they want to play as Heller.

        The Size of the Game was quite big so for your convenience, i have split
        the game into seven parts, so you'll need to download all the three
        parts and extract the files from all the three parts using WinRAR to
        play the game. For more information on how to play these games, read the
        instructions given in first paragraph of this page. The game will be
        pre-installed, so you don't have to install it. REMEMBER THE GAME WON'T
        RUN UNTIL AND UNLESS YOU DOWNLOAD ALL THE THREE PARTS AND EXTRACT FILES
        FROM THEM.
      </p>

        You can download the three parts from the download buttons provided
        below.
