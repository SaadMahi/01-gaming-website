      <h2>Grand Theft Auto San Andreas</h2>

      <div class="description">
        <p>
          GTA San Andreas is structured similarly to the previous two games in
          the series. The core gameplay consists of elements of a third-person
          shooter and a driving game, affording the player a large, open world
          environment in which to move around. On foot, the player's character
          is capable of walking, eating, running, sprinting, swimming, climbing
          (the first GTA game in which swimming and climbing is possible) and
          jumping as well as using weapons and various forms of hand to hand
          combat. Players can drive a variety of vehicles, including
          automobiles, buses, semis, boats, airplanes, helicopters, trains,
          tanks, motorcycles and bikes. Players may also import vehicles rather
          than steal them.The open, non-linear environment allows players to
          explore and choose how they wish to play the game. Although storyline
          missions are necessary to progress through the game and unlock certain
          cities and content, they are not required as players can complete them
          at their own leisure. When not taking on a storyline mission, players
          can free-roam and look around the cities, eat from the restaurant, or
          cause havoc by attacking people and causing destruction. However,
          creating havoc can attract unwanted and potentially fatal attention
          from the authorities. The more chaos caused, the stronger the
          response: police will handle "minor" infractions (attacking people,
          pointing guns at people, stealing cars, killing a few people, etc.),
          whereas SWAT teams, the FBI, and the military respond to higher wanted
          levels.

        The Size of the Game was quite big so for your convenience, i have split
        the game into seven parts, so you'll need to download all the three
        parts and extract the files from all the three parts using WinRAR to
        play the game. For more information on how to play these games, read the
        instructions given in first paragraph of this page. The game will be
        pre-installed, so you don't have to install it. REMEMBER THE GAME WON'T
        RUN UNTIL AND UNLESS YOU DOWNLOAD ALL THE THREE PARTS AND EXTRACT FILES
        FROM THEM.

          <p>
            Hitman: Absolution is a stealth game in which the player assumes the
            role of a hitman named Agent 47. Presented from a third-person
            perspective, the gameplay centers around completing set objectives
            within a series of levels. Objectives can range from simply reaching
            the end of the level, to eliminating specific individuals. The
            players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths to
            get to a target or location. Players may use pistols, bottles or
            bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipe against
            enemies if opting for the action-oriented approach, or avoid enemies
            altogether, not being seen, using disguises, blending into the
            environment, and only attacking the set target(s), if using the
            stealth-oriented approach. Agent 47 also has the 'Instinct' ability
            that lets the player monitor enemies more easily. There are also
            environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use
            poison to spike coffee, pull switches to make a disco ball fall and
            break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, pull a switch to
            cause scaffolding to fall down, cause fires, or set off fireworks.
            Players complete chapters in order to progress through the story.
            The player journeys to various locations, including a mansion,
            library, strip club, gun store, wrestling arena, courthouse, and
            hotel during the story.
