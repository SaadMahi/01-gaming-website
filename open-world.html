          Red Dead Redemption is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and
          published by Rockstar Games. The game is the third entry in the Red
          Dead series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. The
          story is set in 1899 and follows the exploits of outlaw Arthur Morgan,
          a member of the Van der Linde gang, in a fictionalized representation
          of the Western, Midwestern, and Southern United States. Arthur must
          deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive
          against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The
          game's epilogue follows fellow gang member John Marston, the
          protagonist of Red Dead Redemption. The game is presented through both
          first and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam in
          its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts,
          robberies, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player
          characters, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral
          choices and deeds. A bounty system similar to the "wanted" system from
          the Grand Theft Auto franchise governs the response of law enforcement
          and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player. Red Dead Online,
          the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 32 players engage in a
          variety of cooperative and competitive game modes.

        The Size of the Game was quite big so for your convenience, i have split
        the game into seven parts, so you'll need to download all the three
        parts and extract the files from all the three parts using WinRAR to
        play the game. For more information on how to play these games, read the
        instructions given in first paragraph of this page. The game will be
        pre-installed, so you don't have to install it. REMEMBER THE GAME WON'T
        RUN UNTIL AND UNLESS YOU DOWNLOAD ALL THE THREE PARTS AND EXTRACT FILES
        FROM THEM.

        You can download the three parts from the download buttons provided
        below.
